    <h2>1. Subscription service content</h2>
    <p>By purchasing the automatic renewal membership subscription service of this platform, you can enjoy the advanced features and services provided by the platform during the validity period.</p>
    <p>You understand and agree that the company may dynamically modify the specific rights and exclusive services of members based on operational conditions. The latest details are subject to the information displayed on the purchase page of this service.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Subscription period and price</h2>
    <p>This platform offers various subscription periods, including one month, three months, six months, and one year. Specific subscription benefits, durations, and prices are subject to the information displayed on the platform's member subscription center page. iOS users can also refer to the subscription details displayed in the App Store. Users should carefully read and confirm the subscription content before purchasing.</p>

    <h2>3. Automatic renewal mechanism</h2>
    <p>This subscription service uses an auto-renewal mechanism by default. For iOS users, the service will automatically charge the next period's fee to the user's Apple ID account within 24 hours prior to the expiration of the current subscription period, until the user cancels auto-renewal. You can cancel your subscription by opening the App Store -> tapping your Apple ID profile picture in the upper right corner -> going to "Account" -> tapping "Subscriptions" -> selecting Sporreer -> canceling your subscription.</p>
    <p>You will be notified of the upcoming charge 5 days before the billing date via device system push notifications.</p>
    <p>You have the right to cancel the automatic renewal service. If you wish to cancel the automatic renewal service, you must do so before each billing date; otherwise, it will be considered that you agree to continue authorizing automatic renewal.</p>
    <p>You authorize the company to automatically deduct the fee for the next billing cycle from the balance of your Apple ID account linked when you activated this auto-renewal service, or the balance of your linked third-party payment account (including but not limited to Alipay account, WeChat account, etc.) before your membership service period expires, thereby extending the corresponding membership service period.</p>

    <h2>4. Free trial and discounts</h2>
    <p>If this service includes a free trial period, the service will automatically renew at the standard price after the trial period ends if the user does not cancel the automatic renewal.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Price changes</h2>
    <p>If the subscription price is adjusted, the platform will send a notification to the user and seek their consent in accordance with Apple's policies and applicable laws. If the user does not agree to the new price, the automatic renewal will end in the current period.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Cancellation and Refund</h2>
    <p>You can cancel automatic renewal at any time. The current subscription period will remain valid after cancellation, but you will not be charged again. Refund information is subject to Apple's refund policy.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and confirm that if you voluntarily cancel this service, forfeit your membership rights, or close your account after activating this service, or if the company cancels your account or terminates your membership in accordance with laws and regulations, this agreement, or other service agreements and rules, you will not be able to get a refund of part or all of the membership service fees.</p>
    <p>Sporreer's paid membership service is a virtual content consumption. Except in cases of breach of contract by the company due to significant defects in the service rendering it completely unusable, as stipulated in this agreement, legal requirements for refunds, or the company's agreement to refund, once payment and purchase are completed, refunds and transfers are not possible.</p>
    <p>Please note that you should carefully verify your account information, service details, price, and service period before purchasing this service (including automatic renewal). Fees will not be refunded if you cancel or terminate your membership before its expiration date.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>

The company will make every effort to provide you with services and ensure their continuity and security.
